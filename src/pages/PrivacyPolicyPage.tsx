      <p>
        We use your information only to operate the app: authenticating you, storing and displaying your training data,
        and — if you're linked with a coach or client — sharing the relevant training data between you. We do not use
        your data for advertising, and we do not run analytics or tracking scripts of any kind.

    heading: 'Who we share it with',

      <p>
        We don't sell or rent your data to anyone. Your data is stored with our infrastructure providers, Supabase
        (database, authentication, and file storage) and Vercel (hosting), solely to run the app. A linked coach or
        client can see the training data your relationship is set up to share, governed by database-level access rules —
        no one else can see your data.

      <p>
        Your data is stored in a Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL database with row-level security, restricting every query to
        only the rows you're allowed to see. Traffic between your device and our servers is encrypted (HTTPS/TLS).
        SwoleBalli also works offline: your session and recently viewed data are cached locally on your device (browser
        local storage) so the app keeps working without a connection, and syncs back once you're online again.

        Settings — this immediately and irreversibly removes your profile, training data, plans, notes, and coaching
        links. If you'd like a copy of your data before deleting it, or have any other request, email us at{' '}
